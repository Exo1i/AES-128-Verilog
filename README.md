# AES 128/192/256 Verilog Implementation

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that provides strong security for data confidentiality.

## Features

- Implements AES encryption and decryption.
- Supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
- Provides all necessary functions and modules for AES operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your preferred Verilog development environment.
3. Modify the input data and key values in the testbench file to suit your requirements.
4. Run the simulation or synthesis process to generate the output.
5. Verify the results and analyze the performance of the implementation.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the Verilog source files for the AES-128 implementation.

## Usage

To use the AES Verilog implementation, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the AES module in your Verilog design.
2. Connect the necessary inputs and outputs to the AES module.
3. Provide the input plaintext and key values to the AES module.
4. Clock the AES module and observe the output ciphertext or decrypted plaintext.
